        I'm an undergrad student at IIIT Hyd. I was born in California, and moved to Bangalore when I was 11. Bangalore made me who I am today, and living away from home has given me a new found appreciation for it. 
        I really enjoy dancing, and have been learning Bharatanatyam since I was five. I'm super lucky college gives me opportunities to continue practicing and performing it. My most fond memories in college
        are actually all the dances we've done together, from Fresher's, to Independence Day to the Flash Mob. When it comes down to it,dancing just makes me super happy.
        I also really like playing Football. I played a lot in school, and hopefully, soon enough, I'll be able to do that in college as well.
        In my free time, I watch <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>. I've managed to waste a lot of time on Instagram too, so that's nice.
